Dorsal body segments 8–9 are small and inconspicuous, not well pronounced in as in Stenasellidae.

Both <u>larvae</u> and adults are <u>engulfing predators</u> of small invertebrates and fish, and are sometimes cannibalistic.

The <u>larvae</u> get their oxygen directly from gills that can be retracted into the end of the abdomen. Adults have an effective plastron and usually do not need to surface for air.

This allows them to see both above and below the water at the same time. Their nickname, “whirligig beetles” was given to the adult beetles due to their behavior of zipping around in swirling motions along the surface of the water, although they are also good <u>divers</u>.

745,727,,Water Scavenger Beetle Larvae,,Hydrophilidae,larva,Larva,"Hydrophilidae is the second largest family of North American aquatic beetles, including more than 250 species. The <u>larvae</u> and adults are aquatic or semiaquatic; the pupae are terrestrial. They prefer <u>lentic</u> waters such as ponds and shallow lakes, or sometimes pools at edges of streams. Unlike most beetles, the adults of this family tend to swim by alternating strokes with their <u>hind legs</u>, rather than moving them in unison. Also atypical, they have a habit of surfacing for air head first, breaking the water surface tension and accessing air with their specially formed antennae. The adults have a well-developed plastron to hold air underwater; in well-oxygenated water this thin layer of air serves as a gill. <u>Larvae</u> frequently surface to take in air from the end of the abdomen. <u>Larvae</u> are usually predators of other invertebrates, and can even break snail shells with their strong jaws. However, only a small number of adults are predators, most are omnivores or detritivores. ","Each mandible with 1 to 3 teeth along inner margin. <strong><u>Labrum</u> and <u>clypeus</u> not separated by distinct <u>suture</u></strong>.
