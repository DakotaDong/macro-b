332,"​Long, Free Anal Prolegs",The anal prolegs of this family are long and freely movable.
335,Hatchet-shaped Foretrochantin,"The foretrochantin is a projecting sclerite (hard plate) at the base of each foreleg. This is the only family where the foretrochantin is hatched-shaped. Look from the ventral side, you may see the shape more clearly if the specimen is a bit tilted."
338,Anal Prolegs Free,"Anal prolegs (fleshy nubs at the end of th body with hooks on them) are free, not closely fused to the abdomen."

340,Metanotum Mostly Membranous,"Metanotum with 3 pairs of small sclerites, but mostly membranous."
340,​Pronotum with Pointed Anterolateral Corners,"The pronotum of larvae in this family usually has strongly pointed anterolateral corners, giving larvae the appearance of having sharp shoulder pads."
340,​Setose Anal Prolegs,Each anal proleg has a mesodorsal cluster of at least 30 setae.
342,Notched Mesonotum,Mesonotum notched medially along the anterior margin. I.e. the middle thoracic segment has 2 small incisions along the edge nearest the head.
342,Only Metanotum Membranous,"Pro- and mesonota are sclerotized, but the metanotum mostly membranous, with some small sclerites (i.e. the dorsal sides of the 1st two thoracic segments are hardened, but the 3rd is membranous)."

747,Shield-Like,The thoracic and abdominal tergites (dorsal hardened segmental plates) are expanded laterally as a thin shield covering the head and legs from above. This can make the animals resemble trilobites. This shape also helps them stick to rocks almost like a suction cup.
