1,Beetles,Adult Coleoptera,adult-beetles,Sensitive,"Three-pairs of legs; body usually covered by a hard exokeleton. The Most common kinds collecyed are the water penny and riffle beetles, but others kinds are also found.","Beetles are the most diverse group of plants or animals on earth, with over 300,000 species. More than 16,000 of these species live in water for at least part of their lives. Beetles have egg, larval, pupal, and adult life stages. For different species, one or all of egg, larval, or adult life stages live in the water, but usually the pupae are terrestrial. Some larvae have slender gills for breathing underwater, others simply take oxygen through the soft cuticle or pierce stems or roots of aquatic plants. Adults do not have gills, but have various other strategies--Some hold an air bubble against breathing holes on the sides of their bodies and replenish the bubble periodically at the water surface; others maintain a thin layer of permanently trapped air over those breathing holes. Aquatic beetles can be found in water that is either flowing or still, and some even thrive in brackish environments",illustration-adult-beetles,second-adult-beetles

3,True Flies,Diptera,true-flies,Sensitive; Less Sensitive; Tolerant.,"Usually the body is segmented with some type of visible features either along the body, or at the head or tail regions. This order is the only aquatic insect without fully developed legs in the larval stages. Dipterans are very diverse order with many aquatic varieties. ","The Diptera are holometabolists, meaning they have an egg, larval, pupal, and adult life stage. The larval and pupal stage are often aquatic. Greater than 3,500 species that are known to be aquatic or semiaquatic. Larvae of the order are often maggot like, without legs. Adults can be readily recognized by the absence of hind wings, instead they have halters, ball and stick like appendages used for balance during flight. Adult flies are often thought of as pests because they often bight, sometimes aid in the spread of diseases such as malaria, or swarm in high numbers; however, both larvae and adults are an important link in the food chain.",illustration-true-flies,second-true-flies
4,Mayflies,Ephemeroptera,mayfiles,Sensitive,"Three-pairs of legs with a single hook at the end; three some0times two tail filaments; gills attached to the abdomen, which may sometimes be cobered and difficult to see. Mayflies exhibit several types of movements (or habits); swimming, clingers, crawlers and burrowers.","Mayflies, with over 3,400 species, make up one of the oldest orders of insects, with the first fossils dating to about 275 million years ago. They are hemimetabolous, without a pupal stage; however, they are unique in that they have a subimago stage, an extra life stage between the larva and the adult in which the insect has wings, but is still sexually immature. Most of their life is spent as aquatic larvae and most species spend only a few hours to a few days as a flying adult. Different families and genera can be found in a variety of flowing-water and some still-water habitats. They can be burrowers in loose sediments, flat-bodied sprawlers on rocks, or fish-like and very streamlined in shape, making good swimmers. Larvae can be easily identified by only a single claw on each foot, gills on the top or sides of the abdomen, and the presence of two or three slender tails.",illustration-mayfiles,second-mayfiles
5,True Bugs,Hemiptera,true-bug,NA," Both adults and larvae can be aquatic and occupy the same habitat, with both stages distinguished by piercing-sucking mouthparts that may consist of an elongate beak or short cone jutting from their front of the head and projecting back. Hemimetabolous true bug larvae exhibit wing pads on the thorax, which will become one pair of soft hind wings one pair of hemielytra. Most aquatic true bugs act as piercer-predators as both larvae and adults, meaning they seize their prey with their front legs before using their specialized mouthparts to pierce and suck their meal clean","Often, laymen refer to all insects as “bugs”, however, the term “bug” actually refers to a specific order of insects, the Hemiptera, or so-called “true bugs”. Not all members of the group are aquatic, however, there are nearly 5 thousand aquatic or semiaquatic species worldwide. They are hemimetabolous, meaning that the life cycle does not have a pupal stage, and adults and larvae look very similar, except for the lack of wings when immature. True bugs can almost always be distinguished from other insects by the presence of a beak or rostum; this is a piercing-sucking mouthpart, usually long, and held beneath the body (ventrally) when not feeding. These insects are often herbivores, feeding on plant fluids; or predators that inject their prey with digestive enzymes which liquefies the tissues so that it can be easily sucked back up through the straw-like mouth.",illustration-true-bug,second-true-bug
6,"Aquatic Caterpillars, Snout Moths",Lepidoptera ,aquatic,NA,"As the larvae of the butterflies and moths, most caterpillars possess highly terrestrial life histories. However, a rare few experience their larval lives underwater in the rocky substrates of streams and rivers or among the aquatic vascular plants of streams, lakes, or ponds. Here, herbaceous aquatic caterpillars often exhibit the same preference for host plants as their terrestrial counterparts, using their chewing mouthparts to graze microflora or feed on certain species of aquatic vascular plants. Like land-dwelling caterpillars, aquatic caterpillars are distinguished by their elongated, somewhat cylindrical bodies, distinctive heads with at most simple eye spots, three pairs of legs on the thorax, and short pairs of prolegs along the bottom of the abdomen.  ","Most Lepidopterans are terrestrial, however a few of the caterpilars of the family Crambidae are truly aquatic (about 740 species worldwide). They are holometabolous, meaning they have egg, larva, pupal, and adult stages. They can be found in a variety of habitats including lentic and lotic habitats. Most larvae feed on floating plants or algae on rock surfaces. Often, first instar larvae are hydrophilic (water loving) and absorb oxygen directly from the water. As the larvae become larger they tend to be hydrophobic (water resistant) with a layer of air held against the body. This is advantageous, as oxygen diffuses more rapidly through air than water. Similar to the closely related Trichoptera (caddisflies), some species make cases or tents out of plant material and silk. They often have a close relationship with a host plant on which they both live and feed; these plant feeders often cover themselves with pieces of leaf or they burrow in the stem. The algal-feeding species spin a silk tent from beneath which they graze on the algae. They pupate in or beneath the plant and silk matterial, and emrge as terrestrial moths.",illustration-aquatic,second-aquatic
7,"Alderflies, Dobsonflies, and Fishflies",Megaloptera,megaloptera,Less Sensitive,"Three-pairs of legs; large pinching jaws; eight-pairs of filaments attached to the sides of the abdmen. Fishflies also called hellgrammites have a two-hooked tail, whereas Alderflies have a single tapered tail and are usually much smaller ad lighter in color.","The members of this group are holometabolous, meaning they have egg, larval, pupal, and adult life stages. Eggs are laid on plants or other objects overhanging the water, pupae and adults are terrestrial. Only the larval life stage is aquatic. Larvae of some genera can be quite large and all are predators of smaller invertebrates. They can be found in still or flowing water habitats; however, at the genus and species level their habitat preferences are more exclusive. Larvae can be readily identified by the presence of paired lateral filaments or gills along the sides of the abdomen. They typically pupate in dug out chambers in the riparian habitat (in the soil or soft rotting shoreline logs or stumps) or in the dry streambed. Adults can be quite large but likely do not feed. They are usually nocturnal, being most active at dusk.",illustration-megaloptera,second-megaloptera
8,Dragonflies and Damselflies,Odonata,dragonflies,Less Sensitive,"Three-pairs of legs; large eyes; long spoon-like jaws; no tails on the abdomen. Dragonflies have a broad shaped abdomen, while the Damselfly abdomen is much narrower. Damselfly gills are attached to the end of the abdomen, they look like tails.","The order Odonata is split into two groups, the true dragonflies (Anisoptera) and the damselflies (Zygoptera). As adults damselflies have more slender abdomens and their eyes appear more widely separated than eyes of true dragonflies. American damselfly nymphs have leaf- or feather-like gills on the posterior end of the abdomen. These are hemimetabolous insects, and so do not have a pupal stage. Adults are strong flyers, often found near the water. Adults and nymphs are engulfing predators, feeding mainly on small invertebrates. They capture their prey by either stealth or by ambush, snatching them with their labial mask, an arm-like extremity that extends rapidly from the face and brings the food to their chewing mandibles.",illustration-dragonflies,second-dragonflies
9,Stoneflies,Plecoptera,stoneflies,Sensitive,"Three-pairs of legs with two-hooks at the endl two tail filaments; no gills attached to the abdomen but some kinds may have gills near the top pf the abdomen, gills if visible, mostly on the legs and thorax.","Stoneflies include over 3,500 species globally. They’re hemimetabolous, lacking a pupal stage. Eggs and larvae are aquatic, and most adults are terrestrial. Larvae are indicative of good water quality. They are typically found in cold, clean streams. Larvae sometimes diapause (similar to hibernation), especially if living in an intermittent stream, where water levels may drop very low. There’s a wide range of feeding strategies among the different species, but most start as collecting-gatherers and shift to shredding-detritivores or omnivorous-predators. Microhabitats where they live can be very specific as each genus is adapted to particular environmental conditions. Unlike mayfly larvae, stonefly larvae have two claws per foot, never have gills on the top of the abdomen, and never have more than two cerci (tails).",illustration-stoneflies,second-stoneflies
10,Caddisflies (Case-building),Trichoptera,caddisflies,Sensitive (except net spinners); Less Sensitive (common net spinners),"Grub-like soft body and a hard head; Three-pairs of legs located on the upper third of the body; tail is small and usually forked, sometimes finged with hairs; gills are scattered on the underside of the abdomen.","Caddisflies constitute the 7th largest order of insects, with over 15,000 species globally. They’re holometabolous, having egg, larval, pupal, and adult life stages. They spend most of their lives as larvae and can be found in almost all freshwater habitats. Collectively the species of the order are ecologically diverse. Different species are scrapers, detritivores, herbivores, filterers, and predators. Most larvae construct portable tube-like cases or fixed retreats, although some are free living. The cases and retreats are made from rock or plant fragments glued together with silk from their mouth. Both cases and retreats are used for camouflage and physical protection as well as for respiration, by channeling oxygenated water across the animal. Larvae can be identified by the usually-inconspicuous antennae and the pair of anal prolegs each bearing a single hook.",illustration-caddisflies,second-caddisflies
