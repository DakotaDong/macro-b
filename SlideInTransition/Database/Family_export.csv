1,1,"Long-toed Water Beetles","Dryopidae","NA","This family is relatively small, with only 5 North American genera, including 13 species. Unlike most water beetles, the <u>larvae</u> of this family are terrestrial <u>burrowers</u> and only the adults are aquatic, usually found in riffles, although some less-common species can be <u>lentic</u> as well. They are <u>shredding herbivores</u> and <u>scrapers</u>. The long claws of the adults make them good clingers and climbers on woody debris and other substrates. Similar to the Elmidae, these adult beetles use a plastron (thin layer of air held against the spiracles) to obtain oxygen from the water and usually don‚Äôt need to surface for air. These adult beetles can have a fairly long life-span, with the life cycle taking up to two years in some cases."
2,1,"Predacious Diving Beetles","Dytiscidae","NA","This is the largest North American family of aquatic beetles, including over 400 species in about 35 genera.

The <u>larvae</u> tend to be climbers on rooted plants and swimmers; adults are swimmers and divers. Both <u>larvae</u> and adults are <u>engulfing predators</u> of small invertebrates and fish, and are sometimes cannibalistic. Some <u>larvae</u> have a channel along the inner margin of each mandible to help them ingest fluids from their prey. Their bite is quite painful.

12,2,"Water Pennies","Psephenidae","NA","In North America North of Mexico this family includes 6 genera and about 16 species. Adults and pupae of this family are terrestrial, except for females enter the water to lay eggs. The <u>larvae</u>, however are fully aquatic. They are very distinctive, flat, shield-shaped larvae, almost trilobite-like in appearance, with the legs only visible from the <u>ventral</u> side. They are almost always found stuck (suction cup-like) to the sides and tops of rocks, where they feed by <u>scraping</u> <u>periphyton</u> and other food off of the substrate."
13,2,"Toe-Winged Beetle Larvae","Ptilodactylidae","NA","Thoracic legs are present with each having four segments and a claw; the labrum is distinct; the abdomen has 9 segments and distinct tufts of gills in the anal region but without a lid-like operculum."

Aquatic/semiaquatic larvae can be found <u>burrowing</u> in damp sand along beaches, <u>swimming</u> and <u>sprawling</u> among plants in both flowing and still water habitats, sometimes even in water-filled tree holes or pitcher plants. Feeding habits vary greatly depending on the species and maturity of the <u>larvae</u>, they are often predators of aquatic insect eggs, others are <u>collector-gatherers</u> or grazers on <u>periphyton</u> and detritus. Aquatic pupae do not make cocoons; they stay near the water surface and use snorkel-like structures that protrude from the thorax to breathe air. Many adult females bite and feed on blood; they need the protein to produce eggs. The bites of most species cause an annoying itch; some terrestrial species are considered pests and can transmit human filarial worms and diseases of other birds and mammals."
17,3,"Non-Biting Midges, Midges","Chironomidae","NA","This group is estimated to include up to 2,000 North American species. It is the most widespread and often most abundant aquatic insect family. The <u>larvae</u> and pupae can be found in almost any aquatic habitat. They live on the bottom, sometimes within slender tubes of silk and detritus. The <u>larvae</u> must be slide-mounted in order to be identified to genus. Different species vary greatly in pollution tolerance. Shed pupal skins can be collected from surface water and identified, sometimes more easily than for <u>larvae</u> or adults. <u>Larval</u> feeding strategies vary greatly, ranging from <u>collector-gatherers</u>, to predators. <u>Larvae</u> are often abundant and an important link of the food web, as most aquatic predatory species use them as a primary food resource at some point during their life cycle. The <u>larvae</u> pupate on the bottom, and then the pupae swim to the surface to emerge as adults, which usually survive for only a few days to mate and lay eggs."
18,3,"Mosquitoes","Culicidae","NA","In larval mosquitoes, the head is distinct and fully exposed; there are prominent mouth brushes on each side of the head; the thoracic segments are fused, indistinguishable from each other, and wider than the head or abdomen."
19,3,"Meniscus Midges","Dixidae","NA","The head is distinct and fully exposed; the 1st and 2nd abdominal segments each have a pair of fleshy prolegs with tiny apical hooks; the end of the abdomen has two flattened lobes with hairy margins above a small, dorsally sclerotized anal segment with fleshy papillae."
20,3,"Dance Flies","Empididae","NA","The tip of the head is visible but is mostly reduced to a pair of slender rods retracted into the thorax; the mouth hooks (mandibles) move up and down parallel to one another; the body is cylindrical; there are usually four hairy lobes and no spiracles at the end of the abdomen and each of the abdominal segments has a pair of fleshy ventral prolegs with tiny apical hooks; if spiracles are present and only a single lobe is at the end of the body, then the abdominal segments lack prolegs but instead have transverse ventral creeping welts."

Both Limoniidae and Tipulidae are part of the larger group of crane flies, Tipulomorpha. Often these are relatively large, grey or white, soft-bodied, legless <u>larvae</u>. The head is inconspicuous, mostly retracted into the thorax and almost completely hidden from view. They are often sold in bait shops, or used as models for tied flies, especially for bass fishing. Usually, <u>larvae</u> are found <u>burrowing</u> in soft sediment of streams, often near algae or woody debris; but some <u>larvae</u> are terrestrial. They vary in feeding strategy, some are predators while others are <u>shredding detritivores</u> and <u>herbivores</u>. Most species have only 1 generation per year. Pupa usually are found in marginal habitats. Adults resemble giant mosquitoes, with long, delicate legs; however, they do not bite."
23,3,"House Flies","Muscidae","NA","The head is not evident, but is reduced to some sclerotized rods inside the thorax; there are no segmented legs; the posterior end of the abdomen is blunt and smooth, without lobes, spines, or ridges."
24,3,"Hairy-eyed Crane Flies","Pediciidae","NA","The head is not evident, but is retracted inside the thorax; there are no segmented legs; abdominal segments have paired fleshy prolegs on five segments or roughened creeping welts on 4 segments; the posterior end of the abdomen has a pair of long slender lobes and sometimes with retractile anal gills below them."
25,3,"Moth Flies","Psychodidae","NA","The head is distinct and conspicuous; there are no segmented legs; body segments are subdivided into 2 or 3 subdivisions, most of which have hard, dark, transverse plates; the end of the abdomen usually has a relatively short, conical respiratory tube."

27,3,"Black Flies","Simuliidae","NA","There are over 255 North American species in this family. The genera <em>Simulium </em>and <em>Prosimulium </em>include most of these. <u>Larvae</u> spin a pad of silk and glue it it to the substrate, then use hooks on the posterior end to grasp the silk pad and suspend themselves in the current, where they feed. If a <u>larva</u> is disturbed by a predator it uses a strand of silk from their mouth that is tethered to the substrate to climb back to their rock once the predator has left. They use comb-like fanning structures on their head to filter food from the water. Generally, this group is considered tolerant to pollution, however, they can be found only in clean water as well, depending on the species. Adult black flies are terrestrial, and the females are biting pests. The bites can cause allergic reactions in some people, and in cases where the numbers are high can cause blood loss and become dangerous for some mammal species. In the tropics, flies in this family can transmit diseases such as river blindness. Fly fishermen often refer to members of this group as smuts, and sometimes use <u>larvae</u> or pupae in their fly patterns."
28,3,"Soldier Flies","Stratiomyidae","NA","Most of the head is conspicuous but nearly incapable of movement; it has distinctive lateral eye prominences; there are no segmented legs; the body is somewhat depressed and its integument is tough and leathery from calcium deposits."
29,3,"Hover Flies","Syrphidae","NA","The head is not evident, but is reduced to some sclerotized rods inside the thorax; there are no segmented legs; the pair of posterior spiracles are fused with each other and usually on the apex of a telescopic respiratory tube which can be short or very long."
30,3,"Large Crane Flies","Tipulidae","NA","Until recently, Tipulidae included all species of ""crane flies."" As now more strictly defined, this widespread family includes at least 53 species in North America. <u>Larvae</u> of some species are terrestrial, but aquatic <u>larvae</u> inhabit quiet areas of streams and shores of lakes, <u>burrowing</u> in the soil, often among roots, <u>shredding</u> living and dead plant material."
31,4,"Comb-mouthed Minnow Mayflies","Ameletidae","NA","<em>Ameletus </em>was previously included among genera of the Siphlonuridae, but is now the only genus in the family Ameletidae. There are 34 known species in North America, most from west of the Rocky Mountains. <u>Larvae</u> are <u>fusiform</u> or streamlined in body shape, making them strong swimmers and <u>clingers</u>. They are <u>collector-gatherers</u> or <u>scraper-grazers</u>, feeding on fine detritus and diatoms. They tend to be found in cold, fast-flowing mountain streams, especially along edges, undercut banks, and in root masses. The family can often be confused with Isonychiidae or Baetidae, but can be distinguished by its <u>maxillae</u>, each with a row of golden pectinate spines."
32,4,"Small Minnow Mayflies","Baetidae","NA","This family includes roughly 152 North American species. The <u>larvae</u> of this family are usually found in <u>lotic-erosional</u> or <u>lotic-depositional</u> habitats. They tend to be <u>clingers</u> and strong <u>swimmers</u> due to their streamlined, minnow-like body shape. They feed by <u>collecting and gathering</u> food, or by <u>scraping</u> algae and <u>periphyton</u> from rocks and detritus. Adults tend to swarm nearby in open areas after emergence. <u>Duns</u> and <u>spinners</u> of this group are frequently used as models for tied flies in the fly-fishing community. <u>Larvae</u> in this group can be tricky to identify and can be easily mistaken for other families such as the Siphlonuridae and Isonychiidae; however, but with careful attention to detail and patience, they can be separated."
33,4,"Armored Mayflies","Baetiscidae","NA","Armored mayflies have a hard, shield-like plate (<u>notum</u>) covering the thorax and part of the abdomen which offers protection from predators. Typically, the <u>notum</u> covers the <u>gills</u> as far back as the sixth abdominal segment and has two prominent points. <u>Caudal filaments</u> are short and fringed with hairs. Members of this burrowing family are considered <u>collector-gatherers</u> and inhabit pools or runs in sandy streams. Baetiscids swim by tucking their legs under their body and undulating their abdomen and tails."
34,4,"Small Square-gilled Mayflies","Caenidae","NA","This family includes over 30 North American species in 4 genera. They prefer slow-moving or stagnant water where there is an abundance of silt and loose sediment and are often found sprawled on/in the silt or climbing among the plants. They tend to be slow-moving and often partially cover themselves in sediment, making them difficult to spot. They feed by <u>filtering</u> or <u>collecting and gathering</u> tiny bits of food or by <u>scraping</u> algae and <u>biofilm</u> from rocks and other substrates in their habitat. Several genera in this group can be useful to fly-fishermen, but due to the short life-span, it can be difficult to time your fishing trip just right or you will miss the ""hatch"" (<u>eclosion</u> or emergence as adults). ¬†"
35,4,"Spiny Crawler Mayflies","Ephemerellidae","NA","This common and widespread group includes roughly 80 North American species in 9 genera. <u>Larvae</u> can be readily identified, as this is the only mayfly group with gills absent on abdominal segment 2. They tend to be found in <u>lotic-erosional</u> or <u>depositional</u> habitats, often among the rooted aquatic plants, moss, root masses, or woody debris. They usually are poor <u>swimmers</u>, swimming with a floppy motion, and instead <u>sprawl</u> or <u>cling</u> to the plants or other substrates in their habitat. The family has a variety of feeding strategies, differing among species, including <u>collector-gatherers</u>, <u>scrapers</u>, some <u>shredders</u> of <u>detritus</u> or <u>algae</u>, and even one predator. When a <u>larva</u> is disturbed it sometimes raises its tail over its head like a scorpion, possibly as an adaptation to fend off predators;¬†however, they cannot sting. After emergence, adults sometimes swarm atypically high, even above tree tops. This group is one of the most important for the fly-fishing community, with at least 30 different species being used as models for tied flies."
36,4,"Common Burrowing Mayflies","Ephemeridae","NA","<u>Larvae</u> of the mayfly family Ephemeridae have large, distinct mandibular tusks projecting forward from the head, used to help <u>burrow</u> in soft silty sand or marl along the edges of still-water habitats or along the quiet parts of streams. They react negatively to light and immediately <u>burrow</u> back into the sediment if removed. <u>Larvae</u> also have feathery gills along the abdomen, giving them a rather ‚Äúfluffy‚Äù appearance from the <u>dorsal</u> side. They are able to undulate these gills in order to increase flow of water for oxygen intake, which is especially important in the burrows where there is little water flow. The adults of this group are popular for fly-fishing enthusiasts because they are relatively large, and the <u>duns</u> (flying subadults) emerge in large numbers. The <u>larvae</u> are also sometimes used as bait."
37,4,"Flat-headed or Cookie-headed Mayflies","Heptageniidae","NA","There are over 100 North American species in 11 genera in the mayfly family Heptageniidae. They are found in <u>lotic</u> or <u>lentic</u> erosional habitats, often among rocks. They are sometimes <u>collector-gatherers</u> of fine organic particles;¬†however, they typically feed by <u>scraping</u> algae and <u>periphyton</u> from rocks and other substrates at the bottom of the stream. They have a flattened head and body, which allows them to <u>cling</u> to the tops of the rocks, even in fast flowing water, without being swept away, or to squeeze among rocks. This flat body shape makes them great at <u>clinging</u> to surfaces, but fairly poor, floppy <u>swimmers</u>.

38,4,"Brush-legged Mayflies","Isonychiidae","NA","<em>Isonychia </em>is the only genus in the family Isonychiidae. There are about 15 known North American species. They have a widespread distribution east of the Rocky Mountains, and tend to be found <u>swimming</u> in fast-flowing water. They have a <u>fusiform</u>, minnow-like body shape, making them strong <u>swimmers</u> and <u>clingers</u>. Long <u>setae</u> (hair) on the inner margins of the <u>femora</u> and <u>tibia</u> of <u>forelegs</u> are used for filter feeding, a trait almost unique to this group of mayflies (also occurring in the rare family Oligoneuriidae). They are important in the trout and fly fishing community as ""Slate Drakes"" due to their frequent but periodic hatches (emergence of <u>subimagos</u> or ""<u>duns</u>"") and return to the water surface as spent adults (<u>imagoes</u> or ""<u>spinners</u>"") in June‚ÄìOctober."
39,4,"Little Stout Crawler Mayflies","Leptohyphidae","NA","<u>Larval</u> members of this family tend to be found in small streams and rivers in areas of slow flow; however, they can be found in <u>lentic</u>-<u>littoral</u> habitats as well. They are often found <u>sprawling</u> on many different substrates, such as sand, silt, or even gravel, as well as <u>clinging</u> to root masses, woody debris, or among various plants. They usually <u>collect and gather</u> small bits of organic particles for food, or some taxa also filter feed. The <u>larvae</u> in this family have gills well-adapted to their environment; the gills on abdominal segment 2 are <u>operculate</u>, covering the rest of the abdominal gills to prevent them from getting damaged by sediment. <u>Larvae</u> also fan their gills in order to increase the flow of water across their surface area, increasing the amount of oxygen they can absorb. Adults and <u>duns</u> (sub-adults) in the genus <em>Trycorythodes </em>(Dark Brown Spinner, Pale Olive Dun, and Reverse Jenny Spinner) are especially important to the fly-fishing community due to their extremely large emergences."

45,5,"Giant Water Bugs","Belostomatidae","NA","The Belostomatidae, or giant water bugs, include 19 species in 4 genera in North America. Other common names include toe-biters, electric-light bugs (because they often fly to lights at night), or alligator ticks/fleas (in Florida). Some species are among the largest insects. Both <u>larvae</u> and adults live usually among rooted plants in quieter water such as ponds and slowly flowing streams. Both <u>larvae</u> and adults are <u>piercing predators</u>, either stalking or ambushing their prey. Once captured, the prey are injected with salivary secretions to dissolve soft tissue and then the resulting liquid is sucked back through their sharp beaks. Younger <u>larvae</u> and small adults eat mainly other macroinvertebrates, but larger species eat larger crustaceans and small fish and amphibians. There are reports of the largest species consuming baby turtles and water snakes. They are known to feign death, lying still while secreting a fluid from the anus. Even small specimens should be handled carefully because they can inflict a very painful bite; fortunately, the effects soon wear off with no lasting consequences. Males of many species tend the clutch of eggs laid by the female either on the male's back or on vegetation while the male stands guard nearby. Giant water bugs are eaten for food and are considered a delicacy especially by people in eastern and southern Asia."
46,5,"Water Boatmen","Corixidae","NA","The Corixidae, or water boatmen, include about 130 species in 20 genera in North America, making it the most species-diverse family of freshwater Hemiptera. They are very efficient <u>swimmers</u>, moving quickly near the bottom of weedy, quieter water habitats (ponds and slowly flowing streams). They feed mostly on the sap of freshwater plants, but occasionally prey on small macroinvertebrates or even eat small particles of detritus. Eggs are laid on solid objects under water. The front <u>tarsi</u> of males are usually equipped with tiny pegs that can be rubbed across the triangular, grooved <u>rostrum</u> to make sound under water. Both males and females are often attracted to lights at night."
47,5,"Water Striders","Gerridae","NA","There are about 46 North American species of water striders in 9 genera. Using water-repelling hairs on their <u>tarsi</u> (feet) to stay on top of the water and water-surface-penetrating claws to gain purchase in the water-surface tension, these familiar insects skate rapidly on the surface of open water of <u>lentic</u> habitats and slowly flowing areas of streams. Their movements are clumsy on shore. Because adults often lack wings, distinguishing <u>nymphs</u> from adults requires careful examination of genital structures. Both <u>larvae</u> and adults feed on living and dead insects trapped on the water surface."
48,5,"Creeping Water Bugs","Naucoridae","NA","The family Naucoridae includes 5 North American genera with roughly 20 species. However, <em>Pelocoris </em>is the only genus found in the eastern United States. <em>Pelocoris </em>typically inhabits weedy ponds or quiet water.

Be careful when handling them; their bite is painful! Fortunately, the pain soon dissipates and leaves no lasting consequences. Some adults in this family have up to four million tiny <u>hydrophobic</u> hairs per square mm that help hold a layer of air (plastron) against the ventrolateral <u>spiracles</u> while underwater so that they do not need to come to the water surface to breathe.

51,5,"Broad-Shouldered Water Striders, Shortlegged Water Striders, Riffle Bugs","Veliidae","NA","There are roughly 35 species in the family Veliidae. They are referred to as ""riffle bugs"" because they are often found on the surface of fast-flowing water. Members of this group are <u>piercing predators</u>. They wait at the surface and grab small living or dead invertebrates that swim or drift by. The <u>hydrophobic</u> (water-repelling) structure of the <u>tarsi</u> (last segment of each leg) helps them stay on the water surface. Most insects have their claws at the most <u>apical</u> tip of each leg; however, riffle bugs have the claws positioned before the <u>apex</u>. The claws are not <u>hydrophobic</u> and pierce the water surface, giving them ""grip"" for running on it."
52,6,"Aquatic Caterpillars, Snout Moths","Crambidae","NA","Most caterpillars in the family Crambidae are terrestrial;¬†however, a few of these caterpillars are truly aquatic (about 740 species worldwide). They are holometabolous, meaning they have egg, <u>larva</u>, pupal, and adult stages. They can be found in a variety of habitats including <u>lentic</u> and <u>lotic</u> habitats.¬†Most <u>larvae</u> feed on floating plants or algae on rock surfaces. Often, first instar <u>larvae</u> are <u>hydrophilic</u> (water-loving) and absorb oxygen directly from the water. As the <u>larvae</u> become larger they tend to be <u>hydrophobic</u> (water-resistant) with a layer of air held against the body. This is advantageous, as oxygen diffuses more rapidly through air than water. They often have a close relationship with a host plant on which they both live and feed; these plant feeders often cover themselves with pieces of leaf or they burrow in the stem. The algal-feeding species spin a silk tent from beneath which they graze on the algae. They pupate in or beneath the plant and silk material, and emerge as terrestrial snout moths."
53,7,"Hellgrammites, Dobsonflies, Fishflies","Corydalidae","NA","There are 6 genera in this family including about 20 species. The <u>larvae</u> are <u>engulfing predators</u> actively search for food, mostly small invertebrates. Members of this family tend to be found in the fastest part of the riffle, among the rocks; however, some species can be found in still water as well. The <u>larvae</u> (hellgrammites) are often preferred as live bait by fishermen due to their high activity and long life on a hook, making them more likely to attract fish. Adults probably do not feed. Males of some species have very long sword-like mandibles used in mating rituals. (Females prefer males with large jaws.)"
54,7,"Alderflies","Sialidae","NA","The mouthparts are slender, needle-like; the antennae are long and conspicuous from dorsal view; the wing membrane has 4 or 5 distinct, similar cells defined by thicker veins; found beside the water and not in it."

Like most dragonfly <u>larvae</u>, members of this family are predators, feeding on invertebrates and even small fish by stalking their prey. They can be found <u>climbing</u> on aquatic plants or root masses, in still or slowly flowing water. They are sometimes used as models for tied flies for fly-fishing; usually larger species are imitated, and the hook made to sink and be teased along the bottom to mimic their behavior. The adults are <u>perchers</u>, meaning when flying they will frequently pause to rest on branches or other prominent objects for a few seconds before taking off again. Some species migrate, flying South in winter, and as far north as Canada in the summer."
56,8,"Broad-winged Damselflies","Calopterygidae","NA","The family Calopterygidae belongs in Zygoptera, or damselflies, and is not a true dragonfly (Anisoptera). Members of this group live in <u>lotic-erosional</u> and <u>depositional</u> habitats and tend to be found along the margins of streams, in areas of moderate or slower flow, where there is detritus. They are stiff-looking <u>climbers</u> on roots, plant stems, and debris at edges of slowly flowing streams. They are <u>engulfing predators</u>¬†that actively stalk their prey then snatch it up with their <u>labial mask</u>, an arm-like extremity that extends from below the face. The adults of this group are often dark winged with slender iridescent green-blue bodies."
57,8,"Narrow-winged Damselflies","Coenagrionidae","NA","This is the largest damselfly family, including roughly 90 North American species in 15 genera. Most genera are found in <u>lentic</u> habitats, except <em>Argia</em>, which is usually found in streams among rocks and plants. <u>Nymphs</u> are <u>climbers</u> and stalking predators among plants and roots. Some of the <u>nymphs</u> in this group can be used for fly-fishing, but usually are only useful in slowly moving water. Unlike most damselfly adults, which tend to rest from flight on plants, members of the Coenagrionidae tend to rest on rocks or other exposed surfaces.

They are <u>sprawlers</u> along the <u>benthos</u> and <u>climbers</u> on plants. <u>Nymphs</u> can be easily confused with those of the family Libellulidae (Common Skimmers) but can be identified with close attention to the presence of a longitudinal groove on the base of the <u>ventral</u> surface of the <u>labial mask</u>. They molt into adults at roughly the same time as burrowing mayflies, one of their favorite foods."
60,8,"Clubtails","Gomphidae","NA","This family includes approximately 16 genera and more than 80 North American species. This is a fairly common and widespread group, found among debris or <u>burrowing</u> in both <u>lentic</u> and <u>lotic</u> habitats. <u>Nymphs</u> are easily identified by their rather thick antennae. Like other dragonflies, the adults and <u>nymphs</u> are predators. <u>Nymphs</u> bury in the sediment, partially hiding themselves to wait for prey to pass by, and then snatch them up with their arm-like <u>labral</u> mask.

Some species are extremely tolerant of low oxygen concentrations in the water as well as high alkalinity, and <u>brackish</u> water habitats. <u>Nymphs</u> can sometimes be used for fly-fishing in still water habitats. The adults seem to fly in rather unpredictable flight trajectories and tend to have wings patterned with pigment."
63,9,"Small Winter Stoneflies","Capniidae","NA","Small winter stoneflies are named for the long, slender body of their aquatic <u>larval</u> form and for the fact that the adults emerge during the winter and can be seen walking on snow. <u>Wing pads</u> on this family do not¬†diverge from the midline; and abdominal segments are separated by a <u>membranous</u> fold. Winter stoneflies are one of the largest families of stoneflies.

76,10,"Saddle Casemaker Caddisflies","Glossosomatidae","NA","Members of the family Glossosomatidae are often known as Saddle-case Makers. The cases are unique from those of other caddisflies in that they are domed like a turtle shell with a <u>transverse</u> strap of finer stones across the bottom, leaving the underside open on both ends. They tend to prefer rocky bottomed riffles. <u>Larvae</u> gather small rocks from the bottom of the stream and glue them together with silk from their mouths to form their cases. During feeding, a <u>larva</u> attaches a strand of silk to a large rock and to the upstream end of the case as a tether. The openings of the underside of the case are interchangeable so that the <u>larva</u> then turns around in the case to point its head through the downstream opening. It then slowly swings upstream on the top of the rock, pivoting on its tethered thread, <u>scraping</u> and eating the algae and biofilm from the rock as it moves. Once the untethered end faces directly upstream, it anchors that end with silk, reverses itself within its case, cuts the thread from the original tether (which is now downstream), and repeats the swiveling and feeding process from the now-freed end of its case, progressing into the current by alternating the two ends of the case like a pair of mountain climbers ascending a rock face."

A part of the entrance of a retreat has a silken filter net protruding into the current to strain food from the water. This is how they earned the common name, ‚Äúnet spinners‚Äù. The mesh size of the filter net varies among hydropsychid species, corresponding with the current speed of their optimal habitat and the size of the food particles on which they specialize. They spend most of their life hiding in their retreats, waiting for food to get caught in their nets, mostly tiny bits of organic debris, but occasionally small animals; they sometimes also <u>scrape</u> algae from the surfaces of the rocks or other substrates to which their retreats are attached.

As adults, the antennae¬†are extremely long, much longer than the animal, especially in males. This is also one of the few families with bright colors on the wings, thought to be mainly day fliers. These traits may be due to sexual selection, much like a male peacock with his showy feathers. The <u>larvae</u> are relatively small when mature, only ranging 7‚Äì15 mm. Representatives of this family can be found in any still or flowing water habitats, and create widely varying cases of plant or mineral materials or even pure silk, have varying habits (<u>climbers</u>, <u>sprawlers</u>, <u>clingers</u>, <u>swimmers</u>), and eat nearly every type of food, all of which are more particular at the genus and species levels of taxonomic refinement."
