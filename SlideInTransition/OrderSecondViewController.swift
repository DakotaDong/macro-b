However, young mayfly nymphs may feed and grow in streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds for up to two years. As important links in the freshwater food web, young mayflies are often voracious herbivores, detritivores, or even carnivores, in addition to being preferred food sources for many freshwater carnivores."]
